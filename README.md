# FibLib
This is a library all about lying to your players! Please keep in mind that at the moment it's fairly unstable, liable to crash your server, and a bit of a pain to use. I aim to fix all of that in the near future! 

## Setup
For setup instructions please see the [FibLib wiki](https://github.com/Hephaestus-Dev/FibLib/wiki).


## Contact Me
I can be found hanging out on the [Fabric Discord](https://discord.gg/v6v4pMv) as Haven King#2790. Feel free to shoot me a message there if you have any questions.

## License
This mod is available under the MIT license.
